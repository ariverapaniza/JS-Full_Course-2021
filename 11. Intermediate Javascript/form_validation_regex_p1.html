            var r = e.match(p);  // this will match if the email address that we input match the "pattern" that we created in the variable "p"
            var t = r == null ? false : true;  // This will use a ternary operator to check if the email address is "null" or "true" acording to the comparison in the variable "r". If it return a "null" is because the email address is not written or is missing something important, otherwise it will return true because its equal to the "pattern"
            console.log(t);  // This will log if it returns true or false
            return t;  //  this will also return if its true or false, but since it has a "return" this should be the last line of code otherwise it will not continue after this line of code
