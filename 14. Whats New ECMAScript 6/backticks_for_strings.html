//  "// this is a string type. Also we used the '`' "backtick" character that is located next to the number 1 below the "Esc" key and with this "  `  " backtick instead of using the "\n\" for the new line, we use the "  ` " at the begining and at the end of the line and it takes into consideration each time we add a new line and it still considered a "string" type."
