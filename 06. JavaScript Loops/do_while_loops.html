<!-- 
    == (Double equals operator): Known as the equality or abstract comparison operator. It converts the variable values to the same type before performing comparison. This is called type coercion.
    === (Triple equals operator): Known as the identity or strict comparison operator. It does not do any type conversion (coercion) and returns true only if both values and types are identical for the two variables being compared.
