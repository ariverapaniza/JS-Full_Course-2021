        var d = document.getElementsByTagName('div');  // This will get the tag name in this case the div and store it on the variable "d" to use it in the for loop
        for (var x = 0; x < d.length; x++) {
            d[x].addEventListener('click', bup, true);  // after the for loop works it will take the variable stored (div) and use the addEventListener that as soon as we click it will use the "bup" that is "event bubbling". Event bubbling is a term you might have come across on your JavaScript travels. It relates to the order in which event handlers are called when one element is nested inside a second element, and both elements have registered a listener for the same event (a click, for example).  https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing
